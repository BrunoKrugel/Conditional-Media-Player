Here is my Media Player card for home assistant.

Note: I am no expert at coding or Home Assistant. this is my first GitHub project. I'm sure there more elegant ways of achieving this card. I would love to have it in HACS, but do not have the knowledge to do so. If you have any ideas for improvements feel free to comment.

If you like the card as much as i do, you won't mind setting up a few things to get the card working...

## **Prerequisites:**

[Button Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card)

[Decluttering Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/decluttering-card)

you will need to create 3 sensor templates and 1 automation for the card to work. To create a sensor template go to Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers > Create Helper > Template > Template a sensor.
